## Middleware

We added modern security Middleware for Lumen to ensure our APIs are a
little more hardened than a default install.

The internet is a dangerous place, and non-security minded developers
often make mistakes that could easily be avoided.

### App ID

This is the Identifier someone needs to send through to access your
application.

This allows you to add a layer of annoyance to endpoints that do not need
authentication, for example, endpoints that provide certain variables to
applications, but that you do not want to hardcode into your applications.

It's also handy for providing different configuration information from a
common endpoint based on the application in question, useful for things
like white labels.

Set `APP_ID` in your .env and wrap your route in the middleware.

Example HTTP Header

```text
App: 8A53A5C5-8B3D-4624-ACFA-C14945EC4F88
```

### Registration Access Key

Use this to limit access to registration endpoints to add a layer of
annoyance.

This is useful for allowing endpoints for newsletter signups, etc., to
know a key before being able to submit.

Set `REGISTRATION_ACCESS_KEY` in your .env and wrap your route in the
middleware.

Example HTTP Header

```text
Registration-Access-Key: 8647032F-AFA3-4EB1-ABEA-B0A517394A2B
```

### Throttle

Allows you to set limits per route as to how many requests may happen.

This is useful for mitigating DDoS, Brute Force, and Flooding style
attacks.

`'throttle:3,1'` means 3 requests per minute. `'throttle:300,1'` means
300.

Certain common routes have default throttles.

Responds with headers indicating how many requests are left on these
routes, and information about when bans expire.

Before Limit:

```text
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 5
```

After Limit you get a `429 Too Many Requests`, and the Response Body contains

```text
Too many consecutive attempts. Try again in 5s
```

### Common Security Headers

Includes a set of Common security headers for browsers that support them.

Useful for defense against many different types of common attacks.

#### Content Security Policy

A good Content Security Policy helps to detect and mitigate certain types
of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection
attacks.

Content Security Policy (CSP) requires careful tuning and precise
definition of the policy. If enabled, CSP has significant impact on the
way the browser renders pages (e.g., inline JavaScript disabled by
default and must be explicitly allowed in policy). CSP prevents a wide
range of attacks, including Cross-site scripting and other cross-site
injections.

```text
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none', connect-src 'self', 'upgrade-insecure-requests';
```

#### X-Content-Type-Options

Setting this header will prevent the browser from interpreting files as
something else than declared by the content type in the HTTP headers.

```text
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

#### X-Frame-Options

X-Frame-Options response header improve the protection of web
applications against Clickjacking. It declares a policy communicated from
a host to the client browser on whether the browser must not display the
transmitted content in frames of other web pages.

```text
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

#### X-XSS-Protection

This header enables the Cross-site scripting (XSS) filter in your browser.

```text
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

#### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism
which helps to protect websites against protocol downgrade attacks and
cookie hijacking. It allows web servers to declare that web browsers (or
other complying user agents) should only interact with it using secure
HTTPS connections, and never via the insecure HTTP protocol.

```text
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=7776000; includeSubDomains
```

### No Cache Headers

Disables caching

```text
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate
```

### Server Header

Adds information about the server.

Useful for overriding and obscuring the name of the technology running
the web server, e.g. making Apache look like nginx, or for announcing
the application name and version.

```text
Server: APP_NAME (APP_VERSION)
X-Powered-By: APP_NAME (APP_VERSION)
```

Requires APP_NAME and APP_VERSION set in the .env file.

### CORS

Adds support for Cross Origin Resource Sharing.

See `config/cors.php` for all options.

Defaults to:

```php
'supportsCredentials' => true,
'allowedOrigins' => ['*'],
'allowedHeaders' => [
  'Content-Type',
  'Content-Length',
  'Origin',
  'X-Requested-With',
  'Debug-Token',
  'Registration-Access-Key',
  'X-CSRF-Token',
  'App',
  'User-Agent',
  'Authorization'
],
'allowedMethods' => ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT',  'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
'exposedHeaders' => ['Authorization'],
'maxAge' => 0,
```

Should support OPTIONS Preflight with Authorization header.

## JWT

You should use a 512 bit, asymmetrical algo, with certificates.

It is suggested that you use `ES512`, or the `RS512` algo if you are
unable to use `ES512`.

You can make a `ECDSA 512 (ES512)` pair like this:

```bash
# DO NOT EVER COMMIT THE PRIVATE KEY
# Make private key
openssl ecparam -genkey -name secp521r1 -noout -out ecdsa-p521-private.pem
# Make the corresponding public key
openssl ec -in ecdsa-p521-private.pem -pubout -out ecdsa-p521-public.pem
```

You can make a `RSA 512 (RS512)` pair like this:

```bash
# DO NOT EVER COMMIT THE PRIVATE KEY
# Make private key
openssl genrsa -out rsa512-private.pem 4096
# Make the corresponding public key
openssl rsa -pubout -in rsa512-private.pem -out rsa512-public.pem
```

Make sure you set the appropriate variables in your .env

You may use a symmetrical algo, but then you'll be relying on a secret
instead of a keypair. This is not recommended.

Token is blacklisted on logout.

## Roles

There is support for user roles. Specify for a route using:

```php
middleware => ['roles:user,admin']
```

Or for a user to have any role to access a route

```php
middleware => ['roles']
```

### Role endpoints

`roleId` refers to the UUID of the role, accessible through `GET` `/roles`

- `GET` `/roles/{roleId}/users`
- `GET` `/roles/{roleId}`
- `GET` `/roles/`
- `POST` `/roles/{name}`
- `DELETE` `/roles/{roleId}`
- `POST` `/roles/{roleId}/activate`
- `POST` `/roles/{roleId}/deactivate`

### Assigning roles to users

- `GET` `/users/{id}/roles`
- `POST` `/users/{id}/roles/assign/{roleId}`
- `POST` `/users/{id}/roles/revoke/{roleId}`

In order to manage roles your user must have the admin role assigned.

## UUIDs

It is suggested to use UUIDs in your responses instead of IDs, which are
generally enumerable.

This will help mitigate some forms of enumeration attacks.

It is suggested that you use UUID version 4, which is random.

```php
use Webpatser\Uuid\Uuid;
UUID::generate(4);
```

## User Registration

There is augmented functionality with the user models and registrations.

An `_id` field has been added which should be used to obscure the internal
id.

You should use a UUID to protect against various attacks.

Required fields are `username`, `password`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `email`.

Additionally, users are assigned an `_id` and an `api_key` when getting created.

Confirmation codes are sent out via email

See the `RegistrationController` for full details.

## Soft Deletes

Soft Deletes are enabled by default.

This is important for logging, compliance, and forensics should a destructive
action be entered into the system.

## Additional Audit Fields

In addition to the usual `created_at` and `deleted_at` that come with timestamps,
we've added some additional fields to help your API be more compliant.

- `created_by`
- `deleted_by`
- `updated_by`
- `updated_at`

## System User

There is a System User that must be seeded. This user is designed to be
unusable, and should be used to indicate that the system has performed an
action.

Set the appropriate `created_by` and `updated_by` type fields when
performing changes in the system using the system user.

You must set `SYSTEM_USER_ID` and `SYSTEM_USER_EMAIL` in your .env

## Migration

There is a single migration that will setup the base user table and a
password reset table.

`php artisan migrate`

## Seed

There will be a system user added during this process.

There will be 3 roles added - user, admin, and system.

`php artisan db:seed`

## Tests

Run

`./vendor/bin/phpunit`

View the coverage in `/tests/coverage`

## Travis

You need to enable CodeCov and include your token as CODECOV_TOKEN _within_ Travis.

Set an environment variable in Travis for this.

Travis also requires additional environment variables if you want to auto deploy.

## GitHub Workflows

There are several workflows available. You need to set certain github
secrets in order for the workflows to operate correctly.

- PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
- SLACK_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL
- SLACK_WEBHOOK

You need to set additional variables in the following files:

- `auto_assign_issue.yml`
- `auto_assign_pr.yml`

### Label Sync

GitHub labels get synced with the `github_label_setup.yml` file.

If you want to change your GH label setup you must change this file.

Any changes you make directly on GH will be removed on the following
sync.

Labels get automatically applied to PRs depending on the contents.

### Review Groups

You can configure who gets automatically tagged for review in the
`review_groups.yml` file.

### Trafico

Trafico is a 3rd party GH app that provides some nice features. There is
a config file included. It's not vital to install this app, but if you
do you will unlock a lot of nice automation.

## Emails

There are 2 included emailers that form part of the registration and
verification processes.

- Confirm Account
- Password Reset

## Queue and Events

When a user signs up an event is fired which sends out emails to the
new user as well as the admin.

You can use these events as a starting block for building non-blocking
functionality.

## Cache

Cache is pre-configured with tag support.

If you use the `::loadFromUuid($uuid)` method you will benefit from
automatic cache creation and invalidation functionality built into the
base model.

## Required Configuration

- Mail - Used for PW resets and Confirm codes
- Cache - Used for the Throttle
- Queue - Used for Email and Events

It is suggested that you use Redis for your cache and queue.

## .env file notes

UUID requirements are indicated by `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`

Please replace with actual UUIDs for your .env file

## Recommended Installs

It is suggested you configure your server with the following:

- `ext-libsodium` - Additional modern algos
- `ext-mcrypt` - Speeds up some crypto operations
- `ext-gmp` (GNU Multiple Precision) - Speeds up arbitrary precision integer calculations

## Sessions

In case you're wondering, this is stateless. There are no sessions.

## Contributing

Please be brutally critical of this in the interest of improving the
security.

Feel free to contribute back.

I'm sure there are hundreds of ways of improving upon this work. Let's
make the internet a safer place, together.

Security is everyone's problem.
